# Information for Career Tech Students

*From the **[Shepherd High School Facebook Pag*e](https://www.facebook.com/shepherdmihs/posts/506840606177696)

If you are a Career Tech student, please note the following:

The first day of class for GI-TEC Mt. Pleasant and GI-TEC Alma will be TUESDAY, September 6, 2016. Both campuses will be in session a full day, welcoming morning and afternoon students that day. Following the start date, there are no days scheduled off during the month of September for either campus.Please be sure that you are making the necessary transportation arrangements to and from school (when you are not required to be here) for the first week that we are in session. For example, if you are a morning Career Tech student, and not required to be here until 10:30 that first week, please be sure that you have made arrangements to get to school in time for our third hour.

# Shepherd Party in the Park

![image alt text]({{ site.url }}/public/05I3lytTQz0LgkXYbUnwA_img_0.jpg)

Coordinators and volunteers kept the party going on Saturday despite the rain we had in the morning. When I visited the already-in-progress Party in the Park, all of the events had been moved underneath the giant tent which had been set up. Players were competing in the Cornhole tournament, and volunteers were manning the different stations in the Children's games area.

## Demolition Derby

The Demolition Derby was rescheduled from 6 p.m. on Saturday to 2 p.m. on Sunday because the field had gotten so wet from the rainy weather. Around 2 p.m..a large crowd of spectators had filled the stands in anticipation of the start to the demolition derby.

And, judging from what I saw the event delivered: almost immediately cars were crashing into each other, and one of them actually burst into flames. I would have stayed, except the loud noise from the engines was making my three-year-old son cranky.

# Youth Football Night to be held August 25th

From the [Shepherd Youth Football Program Facebook Page](https://www.facebook.com/Shepherdyouthfootball/)

Good Afternoon Blue Jays!!

Reminder that YOUTH NIGHT is Thursday, August 25th!!

The Varsity football team will be hosting their season opener vs Gladwin's Flying G's. They have been so kind to include us pregame. Athletes and Coaches need to line up by the flag pole at 6:15pm, according to jersey number. Smallest to largest as this is how they will be announced. Teams will walk out onto the field and get into a line, when the athletes name is called they will step out of the line and wave to the crowd. It is the same as we have done in the past, for any new athletes/coaches Board Members and Team Moms will be present to assist.

We look forward to seeing Shepherd Youth Football represented by all these Athletes and Coaches. Athletes please make sure to wear your GAME jersey (this is YOUR ticket into the game FREE). Any questions please let us know. Let's Go Blue Jays!!
